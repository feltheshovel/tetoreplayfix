Make old [tetr.io](https://tetr.io/) replays viewable

[tetr.io](https://tetr.io/) updated and old replays are no longer viewable so I made this c++ program to reformat them into something viewable.

I did this using the [JSON for C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop) repository:
Lohmann, N. (2023). JSON for Modern C++ (Version 3.11.3) [Computer software]. https://github.com/nlohmann

This work is not rigorous, I just did close to the minimum necessary to make the replay viewable once again, some stats and stuff might be lost

The point of this was just so remmy could continue his video series on youtube
He plays on a special misamino client for [tetr.io](https://tetr.io/) which formats replays the old way
Then the update came and he could not view them anymore

So this works for replays which are before [tetr.io](https://tetr.io/) S2 update but not too old
I might make one that works for those that are too old if I feel like it
