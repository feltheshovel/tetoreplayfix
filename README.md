Make old [tetr.io](https://tetr.io/) replays viewable

[tetr.io](https://tetr.io/) updated and old replays are no longer viewable so I made this c++ program to reformat them into something viewable.

I did this using the [JSON for C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop) repository:
Lohmann, N. (2023). JSON for Modern C++ (Version 3.11.3) [Computer software]. https://github.com/nlohmann

This work is not rigorous, I just did close to the minimum necessary to make the replay viewable once again, some stats and stuff might be lost
